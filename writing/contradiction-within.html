        <p class="essay-question">Can Kant's racism and sexism, expressed across various writings, be reconciled with his moral theory? If so, how; if not, why not? Why do Mills and Allais argue that it is important to pay attention to Kant's racism, and what are some lessons we can learn from doing so?</p>

        <div class="essay-body">
          <p>Although Immanuel Kant's moral theory is built on universal moral equality, his anthropological writings demonstrate the racist and sexist hierarchies he held. Personally, I do not believe that Kant's racism and sexism can be reconciled with the foundational commitments of his moral theory as the backbone of his ethics is that all beings who are capable of acting with reason must be treated as ends in themselves. According to Kant, this moral status depends entirely on the capacity for rational agency and not on empirical traits. However, in Kant's anthropological writings, he asserts racial hierarchies and stereotypes that deny full rational capacities to non-white peoples and to women. These claims do not follow from Kant's ethics and instead directly contradict them. Rather than revealing a flaw in his moral theory itself, these views reflect Kant's failure to apply his ethics to his personal beliefs. Thus, Kant's racism can be best understood as a personal prejudice that distorts his judgment, not as a feature of the moral framework he describes.</p>

          <p>Despite this inconsistency between Kant's personal beliefs and his moral theory, the universalist structure of his ethics may be preserved. Kant's Humanity Formula does not depend on his personal assumptions about different groups, instead depending solely on the idea of rational nature as an end in itself. If Kant's racist anthropology is rejected, the moral theory retains its compelling egalitarian commitments, thus demonstrating that his moral theory is salvageable despite Kant himself violating it.</p>

          <p>Both Mills and Allais argue that it is essential to pay attention to Kant's racism, although they argue for differing reasons. Mills warns that we must acknowledge Kant's racist exclusions, as without them, we risk interpreting his ethics too "charitably," overlooking how philosophical systems can silently narrow the category of "person." Mills explains that we must recognize how Kant's racism shaped his belief on who has moral standing. On the other hand, Allais argues that Kant's prejudice reveals a personal failure as a result of "self-deception." This ironic failure demonstrates how personal prejudice can distort even the reasoning of a philosopher committed to universal moral principles.</p>

          <p>By exploring Kant's racism, we learn two important lessons. First, moral theories must be explored in their entirety as prejudice can quietly influence who is counted as a rational agent. Second, engaging critically with Kant allows us to preserve what is valuable in his ethics while remaining honest about the limits and failures of its author.</p>
