          <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

          <p>What does it mean to exist? For René Descartes, the foundation of all knowledge begins with the certainty that he is a thinking being. In Descartes' Second Meditation, he establishes that even if everything is uncertain due to the possibility of doubt, the very act of thinking is certain, therefore proving his existence (Descartes, 1641, Meditation II). However, it is crucial to understand that while Descartes is not a skeptic, he implements the tactics of skepticism through rational doubt to establish certainty (discussed in lecture 4). Thus, through a series of introspective observations, Descartes concludes that the self is fundamentally a "thinking thing" (res cogitans) (Descartes, 1641, Meditation II). This limitation of the self to just a thinking thing leaves everything else – the body, the world, and other humans – open to uncertainty. This essay will thoughtfully engage with Descartes' argument and examine if the foundation of the self as a "thinking thing" is sufficient for one's existence. It will also analyze the consequences of such a slender foundation, explaining that while Descartes offers a logical method for identifying certainty, it ultimately isolates the self by detaching one from reality. This essay will conclude by demonstrating the requirement of a leap of faith – the conscious decision to trust in something that cannot be proven with certainty – to have an existence of relational and lived experience.</p>

          <p><strong>Radical Doubt and the Discovery of the Self</strong></p>

          <p>In Meditation I, Descartes searches for a foundation on which to rebuild the house of knowledge – a metaphor he uses to describe the demolition of his former beliefs and starting anew from certainty (Descartes, 1641, Meditation I). In order to prove something exists with absolute certainty, he rejects all beliefs which are susceptible to doubt. Descartes doubts his senses, the existence of the physical world, and even ponders if "some malicious demon of the utmost power and cunning has employed all his energies to deceive me" (Descartes, 1641, Meditation I). This quote portrays the levels of extreme doubt Descartes utilizes to challenge even the most basic beliefs, setting the stage for the discovery of a truth that cannot be doubted.</p>

          <p>In Meditation II, Descartes discovers an indubitable truth: he exists because he is capable of thinking (Descartes, 1641, Meditation II). He explains that if he is thinking, he must exist in some capacity as thinking requires a thinker (Descartes, 1641, Meditation II). Even if everything is doubted, the action of doubting one's own existence confirms that there is a thinking subject and therefore that something exists. Further, he explains that even if the evil demon is deceiving him, he must exist in order to be deceived. This allows Descartes to prove "Ego sum, ego existo" ("I am, I exist") establishing his foundation of knowledge to be built upon (Descartes, 1641, Meditation II).</p>

          <p>After demolishing all prior beliefs through radical doubt, Descartes rebuilds the foundations of knowledge by establishing proof of his existence by thinking. However, Descartes understands that beyond his thinking being, everything is susceptible to doubt, even his body and the world. This leads Descartes to his next question: what kind of thing is he? (Descartes, 1641, Meditation II)</p>

          <p><strong>The Thinking Thing</strong></p>

          <p>Now that Descartes has proved his existence through the act of thinking, he begins his search for what kind of thing he is. Descartes concludes that because he cannot trust the existence of his senses, memories, or body, he can only be certain that he is a thinking thing (res cogitans) (Descartes, 1641, Meditation II). Descartes defines thinking as more than just reasoning, explaining that it includes a wide array of mental activities such as doubting, understanding, affirming, denying, willing, imagining, and even sensing. Descartes clarifies that these acts are directly known by the mind and do not rely on external things (Descartes, 1641, Meditation II). Furthermore, Descartes explains that sensations are considered modes of thought as they occur within the mind. According to Descartes, this is enough to provisionally define what he is: a thinking thing, since these mental activities are directly experienced by the mind, and thus, are certain. However, it is important to understand that at this stage of his inquiry, Descartes does not deny the existence of the body, senses, or external world. He simply explains that they cannot be known with absolute certainty and therefore are not included in the definition of the self.</p>

          <p>As thinking has become the essence of existence for Descartes, the external experiences of the body, senses, and the world are uncertain and potentially deceptive. This poses an important question: if everything beyond thought is uncertain, is it possible to have any genuine human experience if suspended in constant doubt about the reality of the world, the body, and others?</p>

          <p><strong>The Limits of Existence Defined by Thought</strong></p>

          <p>Although Descartes' method for identifying certainty is logically precise, someone who believes in it will find themselves in a precarious position. The extreme distrust of everything beyond one's own thoughts leads that person to potent isolation, disconnecting them from everything familiar and lived. Thinking becomes the only anchor in a reality which may be entirely deceptive. The result is an existential limbo: a state in which one knows they exist, but cannot be certain of anything else. This poses a serious question: if trapped in a paralysis of doubt for everything external, is it even possible to have a genuine human experience? Living in constant doubt may protect us from error, but it also threatens to disconnect us from the very world we seek to understand.</p>

          <p>Descartes' view of the self solely as thinking neglects to account for the profound connection between the mind, body, and the external world. For instance, studies in neuroscience, such as work done by Antonio Damasio, clearly illustrates how our mental states are intertwined with bodily processes (Damasio, 1994). Emotions such as fear and joy are not solely mental because they arise from bodily responses and brain chemistry (Damasio, 1994). Core mental processes of perception, decision-making, and memory all rely on the physical systems of the brain which are shaped by interaction with the external world (Damasio, 1994). This demonstrates that the mind does not operate purely in isolation and instead is deeply embedded within the body and shaped by its surroundings. Similarly, the evolutionary science of our species suggests that our capacity for thinking developed gradually because we were active beings navigating the physical world (Lakatos and Janka, 2008). This strongly suggests that our capacity to think is not the foundation of existence, but rather a byproduct of our embodied experience in a real and interactive world. If it is clear the mind depends on the body and its environment, it seems mistaken to define the self as just a thinking thing.</p>

          <p>While the individual mind is the foundation of existence for Descartes, he also fails to account the impacts relationships with others have on one's own thought process. The development of one's mind depends fundamentally on their interactions with the external world throughout their entire lives. It is abundantly clear that we do not think in isolation and that much of our thoughts are impacted by our engagement with the external world. Even our perception of who we are is shaped by the external world around us.</p>

          <p>By accepting Descartes' proposed radical doubt, the existence of others becomes uncertain, crippling the very social structures that shape thought, identity and meaning. Denying the existence of others ultimately risks reducing the self to something abstract, detached from the experiences that make us human.</p>

          <p><strong>The Escape From Isolation</strong></p>

          <p>Despite being an intriguing idea, one cannot build further upon Descartes' assessment of absolute certainties without succumbing to a state of paralysis. A method focused on the establishment of absolute knowledge ultimately severs us from others, the world, and even our own bodies. This framework leaves us unable to engage with the very experiences that give life substance. Eventually, the question must shift – from deciding what can be known with certainty, to asking what must be accepted in order to live with certainty?</p>

          <p>Although it is likely impossible to demonstrate with absolute certainty that anything beyond thought truly exists, it does not mean we should remain trapped in doubt. Our lack of knowledge culminates in the necessity of a "leap of faith" – a conscious decision to trust in the reality of our world. Refusing to make this leap leaves one stranded in detachment, denying them of the texture and richness of lived experience. By making this leap, one risks being deceived in favor of embracing relationships, action, and meaning. The vast majority of humans make this leap unconsciously, living in a reality without ever comprehending its existential uncertainties. Thus, the question now becomes: are we willing to accept this as a valid way of knowing?</p>

          <p><strong>The Limits of Reason</strong></p>

          <p>A critique one may have with this argument is that a "leap of faith" is irrational and that philosophy should aim for truth, not comfort. They could continue to argue that it is better to remain in doubt than to risk deception by placing trust in things that are uncertain. This is a fair concern as Descartes' method is built purely on the premise that we should only accept what is absolutely certain. From this perspective, placing trust in the external world without certainty may appear to undermine the philosophical pursuit of truth itself.</p>

          <p>However, this objection suggests that reason alone should guide all aspects of human life. While caution against deception is important, pursuing certainty to its logical extreme results in constant doubt of the existence of others, ultimately making any meaningful action impossible. In this state, we are unable to participate in the possibilities of lived experience. One can either remain in a state of endless skepticism, or accept that engaging with life by forming relationships, acting with purpose, and making sense of the world requires a conscious act of faith – not as a rejection of reason, but as an acknowledgment of its limits.</p>

          <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

          <p>Descartes' search for certainty began with radical doubt and led to the indubitable truth that thinking alone proves one's existence. Yet, as this essay has demonstrated, defining the self solely as a thinking thing leaves us suspended in a state where nothing beyond thought is certain to exist. While this may satisfy the desire for logical clarity, it provides minimal space for social interaction and embodied experience. To move beyond this detached isolation, faith in what is uncertain is essential. As neuroscience, evolutionary science, and our own lived experiences reveal, thinking is deeply related to bodily and social existence. Recognizing the limits of reason, we must therefore accept that to truly exist in a shared world, we must live without absolute certainty.</p>
