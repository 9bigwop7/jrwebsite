            <p class="item-meta">2025 – Present</p>
            <p class="item-description">I founded Spartanconsulting.ai to help small and mid-sized businesses utilize artificial intelligence. It began as a one-man-show — sourcing clients, scoping projects, building workflows, and delivering systems end-to-end. As demand grew, I scaled from 1 to 7 team members and evolved from hands-on builder to systems architect and operator.</p>
            <p class="item-description">We built systems that changed how our clients' businesses functioned: AI-powered workflow automation, CRM integrations, lead qualification systems, automated follow-up pipelines, internal dashboards, and AI-assisted content engines. Each engagement succeeded in driving revenue or reducing operational friction.</p>
            <p class="item-description">I led client acquisition, pricing strategy, architecture design, hiring, and quality control. We are on track to generate $128K+ in client value.</p>
            <p class="item-description">Spartanconsulting.ai is more than just a consulting firm. For me, it was a proving ground in sales, leadership, and AI implementation in real-world constraints.</p>

            <p class="item-meta">2020 – Present</p>
            <p class="item-description">Bored during the COVID-19 pandemic as a 16-year-old kid in Zoom school, I founded an e-commerce business where I identified pricing inefficiencies across consumer goods markets and utilized bot software to capture supply, reselling product on Amazon FBA, eBay, and Facebook Marketplace.</p>
            <p class="item-description">What started with $2,500 in savings became a multi-six-figure operation generating $250,000+ in revenue. I built sourcing networks, managed high-volume inventory logistics, navigated platform policy risks, handled consumer relations at scale, and made constant capital deployment decisions under volatile conditions.</p>
            <p class="item-description">A 1,500-member reseller community recruited me as a salaried consultant at 17. I still consult on major releases while the operation continues.</p>

            <p class="item-description">Worked alongside the CEO and regional manager of Happy Dad to expand its operations at the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor.</p>
            <p class="item-description">Identified high-traffic bars, initiated conversations with owners, and helped get Happy Dad stocked and selling. Pushed Happy Dad into social fraternities to reach students at scale, coordinated event-based exposure, and recruited ambassadors to expand the team's reach.</p>
            <p class="item-description">Learned how to sell, build relationships, and grow a brand — one conversation at a time.</p>

            <p class="item-description">No tutorials, no templates, no Stack Overflow. Just AI tools and the determination to figure it out.</p>
            <p class="item-description">The result is what you're looking at — a full personal website with a custom AI chatbot trained to think and respond in my voice, built from scratch through iterative problem-solving across multiple LLMs. Every decision, from architecture to design, was something I had to understand well enough to direct. The LLMs wrote code. I had to know what to ask for, when something was wrong, and how to push toward what I actually wanted.</p>
            <p class="item-description">From this experience, I have learned that the ability to think clearly, ask precise questions, and learn fast is becoming the most valuable skills in our rapidly changing world.</p>

            <p class="item-description">A podcast built on a simple premise: the fastest way to find out what you actually understand is to try explaining it to someone who won't let you get away with surface-level thinking.</p>
            <p class="item-description">He's an aerospace engineer from Portugal and I am an economics and philosophy student from NYC. We think very differently, we're shaped by very different experiences, and that's what makes it work.</p>
            <p class="item-description">Each week, we work through whatever we're learning — philosophy, psychology, physics, strategy, ideas we can't stop thinking about. No scripts, no guests, no production. Just two people using conversation as a tool to sharpen their thinking and hold each other to a higher standard.</p>
