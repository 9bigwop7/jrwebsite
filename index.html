          <p>Detained in a back room of Noi Bai International Airport with an expired visa, no cash, a debit card that doesn't work, and three Vietnamese security officials yelling at me.</p>

          <p>My flight to Australia had been canceled and rebooked. The rebooking pushed me two days past my visa's expiration. They needed 1,300,000 Dong (~$50 USD) to let me through. Cash only. I didn't have it. I had 30 minutes to figure it out.</p>

          <p>I stepped away and stood in the middle of the terminal. Fluorescent lights. Announcements in Vietnamese I didn't understand. I ran through the options. No cash. Card doesn't work. Nobody to contact. I ran around the airport trying to find someone who could help. Nothing worked. It seemed hopeless.</p>

          <p>Then I remembered: I had a crypto hot wallet with Bitcoin on my phone.</p>

          <p>I ran up frantically to strangers. "Hey, I have Bitcoin and I need $50 cash. I'll send you $60 in Bitcoin right now." They stared blankly at me like I was running an obvious scam. Everyone brushed me away. I kept going.</p>

          <p>Eventually, a taxi driver I spoke to referred me to another taxi driver who referred me to a shady guy sitting on a bench. He said yes. We did the transfer standing outside the terminal, motorcycles blaring and cigarette smoke everywhere. I walked back to the counter, paid the bribe, got through security, and made my flight.</p>

          <p>What I remember most isn't the relief. It's that I wasn't scared. The whole time, my brain was just running. Options, angles, next moves. It felt familiar. Like a game I'd been playing since I was a kid. I enjoyed it.</p>

          <hr class="section-break">

          <p>That instinct appeared early.</p>

          <p>In elementary school, I wanted the new Derrick Rose basketball shoes. My parents said no. I decided I was going to get them. I started reselling snacks to classmates. By the time I'd saved enough, I didn't buy the shoes. The game was far more interesting than the prize.</p>

          <p>At 16, I noticed my cousin couldn't get exercise equipment. COVID had decimated supply chains. I did some research and found the same pattern everywhere—demand spiking, supply frozen. Starting with $2,500 I'd made from previous ventures, I scaled JHR Commodities to six figures in revenue within 6 months. I resold everything I could find: patio heaters, swimming pools, video game consoles, Nvidia GPUs, Pokémon cards, shoes, NFTs. After documenting my research and flips, a 1,500-member reseller community recruited me as a salaried consultant. I was 17.</p>

          <p>Last summer, I founded Spartanconsulting.ai, an AI consultancy for small businesses. I'm not technical. I tried building solutions myself and quickly hit a wall. I pivoted, recruited a technical co-founder, and eventually scaled the team to seven. I sourced clients, diagnosed their problems, designed solutions with the technical team, and delivered. We're on track to generate $128K+ in client value this year.</p>

          <p>Outside of work and school, I have solo-traveled through Vietnam, Taiwan, and South Korea with no itinerary or hotels. Just a backpack and a plane ticket. I scuba dive and freedive. I read and write a lot, and I co-host a podcast with a close friend where we talk about philosophy, self-improvement, books, and whatever else we're enjoying.</p>

          <p class="contact-line">I like meeting people. If any of this is interesting, reach out.<br>
